  </p>

  <div className="about-section">
    <h3>üíª How It Works</h3>

    <p><strong>Doctors</strong> can securely log in, view all appointments assigned to them, write digital prescriptions, and conduct teleconsultations.</p>
    <p><strong>Clinics</strong> can request prescription refills and consult with doctors to streamline patient care and ensure essential supplies are always available.</p>
    <p>All user data, appointments, and prescriptions are securely stored and managed using Firebase Firestore, ensuring privacy and real-time updates.</p>
